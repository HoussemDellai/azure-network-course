## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

We **recommend using `azd` cloud build**, which always builds images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds**

Use this command to build the image locally:

```shell
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t image .
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
