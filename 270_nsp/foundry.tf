## Added AI Foundry account purger to avoid running into InUseSubnetCannotBeDeleted-lock caused by the agent subnet delegation.
## The azapi_resource_action.purge_ai_foundry (only gets executed during destroy) purges the AI foundry account removing /subnets/snet-agent/serviceAssociationLinks/legionservicelink so the agent subnet can get properly removed.
